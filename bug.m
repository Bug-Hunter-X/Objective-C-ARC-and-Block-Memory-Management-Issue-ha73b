In Objective-C, a rare but impactful bug can arise from the improper handling of memory management when dealing with blocks and ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Specifically, if a block captures a strong reference to an object that's already being released or is about to be deallocated, a dangling pointer exception could occur. This often manifests as a crash or unexpected behavior, particularly if the block is executed after the object it captures has been released.  Consider the following example where a block is created and used within the scope of another object:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    __weak MyClass *weakSelf = self;
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{ 
        MyClass *strongSelf = weakSelf; // Use weakSelf before accessing self in block
        if (strongSelf) {
            NSLog(@"My string: %@
", strongSelf.myString);
        }
    });
}
@end
```

If `myString` or `self` is released before the block executes, the app could crash. This could occur in scenarios where there's a delay before the block is executed, or if the lifecycle of `MyClass` changes unexpectedly.
